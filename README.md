ðŸŽ® What is the game about?

Decide your fate and create something beautiful in this series of meaningful choices.
This game was made for the Indiecade Hidden Heroes game jam. We had to pick our hidden hero and make a game for them. I decided to pick my parents and make a game about my little sister. Loss can be hard, but together we can overcome it.
I hope I can inspire and touch you with this story.
